# Welcome, comrade
Welcome to a website brought to you by the world's most unoriginally named team.

It's pretty simple, there are 3 pages that are basically half-assed attempts at mimicking some sort of board game,
even though none of them actually work with one another and don't share any code.

Please waste your time and admire the beautifully shitty appearance and underlying code of this website we pissed 4 hours away making.
